        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <P>Junior Software Developer with a Diploma in Full Stack Software Development from the
            Code Institute. Proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python. I am eager to gain entry
            into an exciting development team where I can grow and contribute. Currently working as a
            Network Operations Analyst and desire to switch my career into software development
            industry. I am a valuable team player with strong communication skills and effective
            problem-solving ability.
            <br>
            <br>
            With a solid background in Network Operations and a deepening expertise in software development, 
            I am excited to bring a unique blend of infrastructure awareness and software engineering skills.
            <br>
            <br>
            During my career in Network Operations, I developed a keen understanding of systems performance, 
            uptime, and the real-world demands placed on software in production environments. Over time, my 
            curiosity about the software driving these systems led me to pursue a more hands-on role in 
            development. I have since honed my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, frameworks like Bootstrap, 
            Flask, Django and contributed to personal projects.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am eager to continue growing as a software developer and to do so in an environment that values 
            collaboration, learning, and technical excellence. 

        </P>
